SSE Timing
-- For the code given it was hard to decide where the SIMD instructions 
would best be used. I wasn't able to find anywhere to put the instructions
and have it run properly.

OpenMP
-- This shares very similar times to the <threads> parallelization, only 
being slightly slower. The reason this would be slower is because there is
more overhead with OpenMP. It causes the compiler to do a bit more work
that is our of your control than just using <threads>. 
It's much simpler to use though.

<threads> 
-- Gave the fastest times as it has the least overhead. <threads> is a more
direct way of making your code parallel.
